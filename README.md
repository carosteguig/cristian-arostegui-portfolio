# React Portfolio

This portfolio could have been made with HTML and SCSS. Maybe I didn't need to use react, but I saw this as an opportunity to put into practice everything I have been learning!

I not only played around with reusable components. I also wanted to experiment with colours and some CSS tricks here and there!
